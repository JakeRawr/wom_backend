Server code for a Yelp-style app intended for "foodies". Restaurants are initially searched through food genres (Burgers,pizza,curry,etc), and ratings are categorized by food genres. Each submitted review will contain a rating (1-5) for 5 predtermined categories for each food genre. (i.e. Burgers have the 5 categories of Buns,meat,sauce,veggies,and presentation) along with a comment. Restaurants have overall average ratings for each one of the genres that have submitted reviews, as well as averages for each of the 5 categories.
